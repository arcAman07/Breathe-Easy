Delhi's average AQI(Air Quality Index) today is varying between 370 to 430, 
making breathing extremely difficult. The massive amount of pollutants in the air is causing an unfortunately huge number of diseases of various types within the people living in and around Delhi. Even the air inside homes and other enclosed areas is of very poor quality.

To devise a method which can measure the AQI of the space and switch on the mechanisms which can lead to purification of the air inside the premises. For detection of indoor air quality, we plan to use a sensor to measure the Air Quality Index and send it to our microcontroller. The microcontroller will then use a WiFi-module to push the AQI data to an app.
We will use an MQ sensor for sensing purpose and Arduino for processing the sensor data. We will use a WiFi module for pushing the processed sensor data to an app which can be viewed by the user.

There are many projects, which can do Attentivity checking. But we have an advanced project which apart from doing Attention checking, does mood recognition and focuses on the mental health of children during these tough times. The mental development of a child occurs most in these foundational stages, and such effects on mental health at early stages can have a lifelong impact, and can even have a negative impact on a child’s attitude in the future. Utmost importance has to be given to a child’s mental health at these stages, and our app helps in doing so by breaking the barrier.

The microcontroller will interpret the AQI values. If these AQI values are found harmful, the microcontroller with command the servo motors to move and close the mask of the user. All these values will be fed to an application which will be built wherein the user can view all these details on his smartphone
